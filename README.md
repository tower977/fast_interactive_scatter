# fast_interactive_scatter

This script was developed to churn out a scatter plot of two selected columns quickly.
The outputted file is saved to a html file that can be shared easily among peers to be opened on their machines locally.

The file is interactive and allows for quick analysis of the different features of aa data frame.

The sequence of parameter input is as follows:

python3 | name of file | file type e.g. workbook.xlsx | pathway to said file | column to be plotted on x_axis | column to be plotted on y_axis | title of chart | xaxis title | yaxis title | output file
